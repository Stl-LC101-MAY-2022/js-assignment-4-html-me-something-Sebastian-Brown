            <h2> My Favorite Pop Song!</h2>
            <p>Pop was definitely still really big when I was a kid, so I heard a lot on the radio. My favorite pop song would have to be  Down by Jay Sean.</p>

         <article class="country">
            <h2 >My Favorite Country Song!</h2>
            <p>I used to hate country music with a passion. However, in an effort to have more things to connect with my friends on I bit the bullet and started listening. Over time it grew on me and I can definitely enjoy some country song and can recognize the appeal of most. As for my favorite country song, that would be Chicken Fried by Zach Brown Band.</p>
